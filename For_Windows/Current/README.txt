FreeFi




###First time Setting up

1 Run **FreeFi.exe** and if UAC window pops up select allow.
2 Follow instructions on screen to set wifi *name* and *password*.

3 In lan/ethernet settings turn on internet sharing for ethernet/your internet source network.  <IMPORTANT>
--Will update soon to make this automatic.--



###REGULAR USE
* Use **Hotspot_on_off.exe** as on/off switch.

#####About  '*Hotspot_on_off.exe*
* It is a toggle (on/off) switch. 
* If hotspot is currently ***on*** it will turn wifi sharing(hotspot) ***off***.
* If hotspot is currently ***off*** it will turn wifi sharing(hotspot) ***on***.

^Tricks:
Pin it to the taskbar for one click access.





###Troubleshooting

Error 1- "The wireless local area network interface is powered down and doesn't support the requested operation"
Cause    : Self explanatory
Solution : Switch on your damn wifi. How else you gonna share?!

Error 2- "The wireless local area network interface is not in a state to perform that operation"
Cause    : Its state most probably is OFF.
Solution : Switch on your damn wifi. How else you gonna share?

Error 3- "Connected to FreeFi but no internet on mobile"
Cause 1  : Havent followed step 3 in Setting Up
Solution : (For Windows 8/8.1/10)
	1. Switch Hotspot onn
	2. Goto "Network Connections"
	3. Right click on Ethernet(xxxxxxxxx.ac.in) and click on Properties
	4. Under Sharing tab click "Allow other network users to connect" checkbox (to tick it)
	5. Set Home networking connection to "Local Area Connection* xx" (The one corresponding to your Hotspot name)
  	If it is already set ,repeat 4,5.

Cause 2  :Your Antivirus' firewall is not letting mobile connect to internet.Ex "Bitdefender 2015" may do this by default.
Solution :Turn "Block internet sharing" toggle off. Exact wording depends on the firewall software.
